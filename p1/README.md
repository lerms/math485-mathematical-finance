After installing Anaconda using the above guide, you should have no issues viewing the Jupyter Notebook or running any Python 3 code.

Anaconda installs Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and lots of other useful open source Data Science packages.

<h3>Running Jupyter Notebooks</h3>

If you have Jupyter installed you can look at the notebooks with:

`jupyter notebook`

then open binomial.ipynb or model_calibration.ipynb

or just look at the output on github

<h3>Running Command Line Interface</h3>

If you want to run the command line interface using your own arguments use:

`python main.py`
